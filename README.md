4. **Manage Debt**: Pay off your loan or borrow more money

## üß† Game Mechanics

### Drugs
The game features six types of drugs, each with different price ranges and volatility:
- Weed: $300-$800 (Low volatility)
- Cocaine: $1,000-$3,000 (Medium volatility)
- Heroin: $5,000-$9,000 (High volatility)
- Acid: $1,000-$4,000 (Very high volatility)
- Speed: $250-$1,500 (Medium volatility)
- Ludes: $10-$60 (Low volatility)

### Locations
You can travel between six locations in NYC:
- Bronx
- Brooklyn
- Queens
- Manhattan
- Staten Island
- Central Park

Each location has different price patterns and risk levels.

### Random Events
During gameplay, you may encounter random events:
- Police Bust: Lose some drugs and cash (money in the bank is safe)
- Price Spike: Drug prices suddenly increase, sell everything you have!
- Price Plummet: Drug prices suddenly drop by 40-60%, great time to buy!
- Mugging: Lose some cash (money in the bank is safe)
- New Trenchcoat: Find a new trenchcoat that increases your inventory capacity by 100 units (can only happen once per game)

### Buying and Selling Drugs
You can buy drugs at the current market price and sell them later for a profit. Each drug has its own price range and volatility. Prices vary by location and day.

### Inventory Management
Your trenchcoat has limited space (initially 100 units). You can find a new trenchcoat that increases your capacity by 100 units.

### Loan Shark
You start the game with debt to a loan shark. You can borrow more money or repay your debt at any time. Interest accrues daily at 10%.

### Bank
The bank allows you to deposit your cash for safekeeping. Money in the bank is protected from police busts and muggings, adding a strategic element to your cash management. You can deposit and withdraw money at any time.

### Travel
You can travel between different locations in NYC. Each travel takes one day, and prices may change when you arrive at a new location.
